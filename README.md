## Gender Classification using CNN

The main goals of the project are:
* Analyze the dataset, preprocess and split
* Create folder structure and filling with proper images
* Implement image visualization using image name, image generators, etc. 
* Define and train various models (new, predefined, pretrained), compare the results
  - varying the number of specific blocks, the sizes of layers, the activation function and optimizer
  - VGG16, ResNet50
* Visualizing the models and the image predictions
* Apply techniques to prevent overfitting 
* Saving and loading the weights and the train history
* Creating a dataframe with all results (loss, train/validation/test accuracies, epochs, etc.) and preprocessing it(save, load, expload, etc.)
* Plotting the results
